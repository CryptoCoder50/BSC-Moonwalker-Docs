# General FAQ

![](../.gitbook/assets/docs-masthead-17-.png)

This FAQ page answers some of the more commonly asked questions from the MoonwalkerSwap community.

## How can I stake DUST?

You can stake your DUST in MoonwalkerSwap Space Pools. Visit the [Syrup Pools page](https://home.moonwalker.network/pools).

Read our [How to Stake in Space Pools guide](https://docs.moonwalker.network/products/space-pool/space-pool-guide) if you'd like a hand getting started with staking.

## What is the difference between staking and farming?

Staking in Space Pools and farming with Yield Farming are both ways to earn more DUST by supporting MoonwalkerSwap.

Staking only needs some DUST to be added to a Space Pool to earn DUST or other tokens.  
[Learn more about Space Pool staking.](https://docs.moonwalker.network/products/syrup-pool)

Farming is more complicated and needs LP Tokens to earn DUST.

## How do I farm?

We have a [Yield Farming guide](https://docs.moonwalker.network/products/yield-farming/how-to-use-farms) if you're interested in learning how to farm.

## Where can I view the MoonwalkerSwap roadmap?

You can [view our to-do list here, but don't call it a roadmap](https://docs.moonwalker.network/roadmap).

## How do I connect my wallet to Binance Smart Chain and MoonwalkerSwap?

We have a [Connect Your Wallet to MoonwalkerSwap guide](https://docs.moonwalker.network/get-started/connection-guide) covering this in detail.

## What's the best wallet for MoonwalkerSwap?

It depends on your needs. We have an [in-depth guide to selecting and creating a wallet](https://docs.moonwalker.network/get-started/wallet-guide) that's right for you.

## Why is my transaction failing?

You can check the status of a transaction on [https://bscscan.com/](https://bscscan.com/).

Our [Troubleshooting Errors guide](https://docs.moonwalker.network/help/troubleshooting) may have a solution for your problem if you're having issues.

You can also see our [Fixing Stuck Pending Transactions guide](https://docs.moonwalker.network/help/unsticking-a-transaction-stuck-as-pending-with-metamask) if you have a stuck transaction.

## When will you open more pools?

New Pools are added to MoonwalkerSwap frequently. There will always be an announcement before the launch of new pools.

Join the [announcements Discord group](https://discord.gg/RSRMJsvp) to learn about new Pools as early as possible.

## Did Farm APR calculation change?

Previously, rewards earned by LP Token-holders generated from trading fees were not included in Farm APR calculations. APR calculations now include these rewards, and better reflect the expected APR for Farm pairs.

## How do I get airdrops?

Whenever there is an official airdrop on MoonwalkerSwap it will be announced along with the requirements.

Please remember anyone can airdrop tokens to MoonwalkerSwap users since every transaction is public on BscScan. Be sure to do your own research when it comes to non-official airdrops. To protect your funds, we recommend you don't use a smart contract you don't understand from a source you don't trust.

## How can I report a bug?

Learn about our [bug bounty and potential bounty payouts](https://docs.moonwalker.network/code/bugs).

## Where can I view smart contracts?

Learn how to find smart contracts on our [Finding Contracts page](https://docs.moonwalker.network/smart-contracts/finding-contracts).

## Why does it say I have no BNB balance?

If you've already [transferred BNB into your Binance Smart Chain-enabled wallet](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/get-started/bep20-guide) but still have this error, you're most likely not [connected to Binance Smart Chain](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/get-started/connection-guide) within your wallet. Check your wallet's selected network and make sure you have Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\) selected.


## What is the max supply of DUST?

$DUST does not have a maximum supply. The circulating supply is managed through built-in burning and regular burning events.

## What are the treasury funds used for?

The treasury funds are used to cover the expenses involved in running MooonwalkerSwap. These expenses include salaries, audits, prizes, hosting, upkeep, bounties, etc.

## Is MoonwalkerSwap protected from flashloan attacks?

MoonwalkerSwap's vault has anti-flashloan protection. MoonwalkerSwap’s DUST token isn’t vulnerable to flash loan attacks. Unlike vulnerable tokens, DUST token minting is predefined, and can’t be adjusted in a single transaction. Ownership cannot be transferred outside of AstroChef contract.

MoonwalkerSwap’s other smart contracts, like IFO and Pool, are protected as well; they prevent other contracts from interacting with them, reducing the scope of vector attacks.
