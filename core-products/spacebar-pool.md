# SPACE Pool

**Imagine:**

1. You STAKE your DUST to get SPACEBAR
2. Now you are earning a portion of 25% of each block reward
3. Now you stake that SPACEBAR and start earning tokens from brand new BSC projects

This is galaxy mega brain DUST compounding.

Your DUST is now pulling in **multiple** income streams.

Sounds‚Ä¶ ‚Äúsweet‚Äù, right? üòè

**SPACEBAR Pool: where sweet, new tokens meet the MoonwalkerSwap community!**

Spacebar Pool allows Binance Smart Chain projects to bootstrap adoption by distributing a portion of their tokens to SPACEBAR token holders.

SpaceBar Pool will be split into two sections: Core and Community.

* Core will be initially selected by the MoonwalkerSwap team.
* Community will be projects that pass a community vote on the governance portal.

Note that any project will be able to distribute tokens via Spacebar Pool but only projects that win a vote would be listed on the swap interface as a default option \(in order to discourage scams\).

**Why would projects want to participate?**

Since MoonwalkerSwap has had the [fairest launch ever](https://medium.com/@pancakeswap/the-fairest-launch-ever-5b246644ba2a), SpaceBar Pool projects will allow projects to receive market attention by issuing tokens to the largest \(and most active\) BSC community.

Projects will also receive an immediate default listing on the MoonwalkerSwap interface, obtaining priority promotion on the exchange \(by ranking temporarily first in selecting tokens on the website\).

**Extending the utility of SPACEBAR tokens**

Governance, collecting fees, stacking DUST block rewards.

With SYRUP Pool, a new function has been offered for DUST holders in MoonwalkerSwap: adding the toppings to $SBT and the $DUST.
