#### Trade, Earn, and Win.
{% endhint %}

## ↔️ Trade

> Instantly swap crypto tokens: no registration or account needed.

### The people's choice

MoonwalkerSwap is the leading decentralized exchange on Binance Smart Chain, with the highest trading volumes in the market \(sources: [1](https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/decentralized) [2](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/)\).

### Low fees

Why pay more? MoonwalkerSwap runs on Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain with much lower transaction costs than Ethereum or Bitcoin.   
Trading fees are lower than other top decentralized exchanges too, so that's a double win for you!

### Decentralized

Trade directly from your wallet app.   
Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, MoonwalkerSwap doesn’t hold your funds when you trade: **you have 100% ownership of your own crypto**. 

## 💸 Earn

> Earn DUST and other tokens for free with super high interest rates.

### Earn tokens with Space Pools

Stake DUST, earn free tokens. It’s really that easy.   
DUST holders right now are earning tens of millions of USD worth of free tokens each week from major projects. New projects join the party every day, so you can earn more, for even longer.

### Earn DUST with Yield Farms

Stake LP tokens, earn DUST. You take on a little more exposure to market fluctuations than with the Space Pools, but can earn higher APR to offset the risk.

### Earn Trading Fees

No farm? No problem. Even if your trading pair isn’t supported on the Farms page, you can still earn trading fees when you stake your tokens in Liquidity Pools \(LPs\).



**Sounds like fun?  
Then get flipping!** 🐰 🥞
