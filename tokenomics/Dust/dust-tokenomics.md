# DUST Tokenomics

![](../../.gitbook/assets/en%20%284%29.png)

## **Emission rate**

### **Per block**

| **Metric** | **Emission/block \(DUST\)** | **Emission/day \(DUST\)** |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| Emission | 40 | 1,152,000 |
| Burned | -25 | -720,000 |
| **Effective Emission** | **&lt;15\*** | **386,000\*** |

In addition to the above, a dynamic amount of DUST is also minted to the [Dev address](https://www.bscscan.com/address/0x6368f0267b916CC578657D6C897F49426bbBd6E7) at a rate of 9.09%. This means that if 100 DUST are harvested, then 9.09 CAKE is minted in addition and sent to the Dev Address.

**However, all DUST minted to the Dev address is burned in the monthly burn** **and never enters circulation. As such, we have not included it in the above emission rate.**

## Distribution

| Distributed to | Reward/block \(% of emission\) | Reward/block \(total DUST\) | Reward/day |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Farms | 12.5% | 5 | 144,000 \(approx\) |
| of which diverted and burned |  |  | -45,000 |
| Space Pools | 25% | 10 | 288,000 \(approx\) |
| **Total Daily DUST Emission** |  |  | **386,000 \(approx\)** |

## **Other Deflationary Mechanics** 

At present, DUST is also burned in the following ways:

* **0.05%** of every trade made on MoonwalkerSwap
* **100%** of DUST sent to the Dev address
* **100%** of DUST raised in IFOs
* **100%** of DUST bid during Farm Auctions
* **45,000** CAKE per day \(historically assigned to the lottery\) \(_The DUST for this is generated by a farm - PID 137\)_
* **2%** of every yield harvest in the DUST Pool

The burning address which will be used. [View burn address here](https://bscscan.com/token/0x3f4478013b11952942e6718c2d3a7761631b6769?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead).
