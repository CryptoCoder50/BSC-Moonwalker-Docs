## General FAQ

![](.gitbook/assets/help.png)

This FAQ page answers some of the more commonly asked questions from the MoonwalkerSwap community.

### How can I stake DUST?

You can stake your DUST in MoonwalkerSwap Space Pools. Visit the [Space Pools page](https://home.moonwalker.network/pools).

Read our [How to Stake in Space Pools guide ](space-pools.md#space-pools)if you'd like a hand getting started with staking.

### What is the difference between staking and farming?

Staking in Space Pools and farming with Yield Farming are both ways to earn more DUST by supporting MoonwalkerSwap.

Staking only needs some DUST to be added to a Space Pool to earn DUST or other tokens.\
Learn more about [Space Pool staking](space-pools.md#stake-dust-earn-more-dust).

Farming is more complicated and needs LP Tokens to earn DUST.\

Join the [announcements Discord group](https://discord.gg/RSRMJsvp) to learn about new Pools as early as possible.

### Did Farm APR calculation change?

Previously, rewards earned by LP Token-holders generated from trading fees were not included in Farm APR calculations. APR calculations now include these rewards, and better reflect the expected APR for Farm pairs.

### How do I get airdrops?

Whenever there is an official airdrop on MoonwalkerSwap it will be announced along with the requirements.

Please remember anyone can airdrop tokens to MoonwalkerSwap users since every transaction is public on BscScan. Be sure to do your own research when it comes to non-official airdrops. To protect your funds, we recommend you don't use a smart contract you don't understand from a source you don't trust.

### How can I report a bug?

### Where can I view smart contracts?

Learn how to find smart contracts on our[ Finding Contracts page](contact-us.md#customer-support).

### Why does it say I have no BNB balance?

If you've already transferred BNB into your Binance Smart Chain-enabled wallet but still have this error, you're most likely not connected to Binance Smart Chain within your wallet. Check your wallet's selected network and make sure you have Binance Smart Chain (BSC) selected.

### What is the max supply of DUST?

$DUST does not have a maximum supply. The circulating supply is managed through built-in burning and regular burning events.

Read this to learn more about [MoonwalkerSwap's LP](moonwalkerswap-exchanges.md#lp-tokens).

### What are the treasury funds used for?

The treasury funds are used to cover the expenses involved in running MoonwalkerSwap. These expenses include salaries, audits, prizes, hosting, upkeep, bounties, etc.

### Is MoonwalkerSwap protected from flashloan attacks?

MoonwalkerSwap's vault has anti-flashloan protection. MoonwalkerSwap’s DUST token isn’t vulnerable to flash loan attacks. Unlike vulnerable tokens, DUST token minting is predefined, and can’t be adjusted in a single transaction. Ownership cannot be transferred outside of AstroChef contract.

MoonwalkerSwap’s other smart contracts, like IFO and Pool, are protected as well; they prevent other contracts from interacting with them, reducing the scope of vector attacks.

### Can I join the MoonwalkerSwap team?

Space-themed DeFi protocol? You know it. MoonwalkerSwap is a Binance Smart Chain-based DEX launched by anonymous devs with a penchant for Dust LP tokens.

It looks a bit like Ethereum’s UniSwap (community governance, the ability to farm liquidity provider tokens), but also incorporates many other features that let you earn rewards.

Introduction The Space-based farming craze has captivated participants in the crypto space for months. In the latest wave of DeFi protocols, we’ve seen numerous platforms emerge that allow users to stake their funds in return for the protocol’s tokens.

The bulk of this activity has been concentrated on the Ethereum blockchain. As one of the earliest blockchains supporting smart contracts, it has a sprawling community of users, developers, and tools for building powerful decentralized applications. In this article, we’ll take a look at PancakeSwap – a decentralized exchange built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

What is MoonwalkerSwap? MoonwalkerSwap is a decentralized exchange for swapping BEP-20 tokens.

The MoonwalkerSwap exchange UI.

Familiar with Uniswap or SushiSwap? Then you’ll have no issue grasping MoonwalkerSwap – they are quite similar in their core design.

The MoonwalkerSwap exchange MoonwalkerSwap uses an automated market maker (AMM) model. That means that while you can trade digital assets on the platform, there isn’t an order book where you’re matched with someone else. Instead, you trade against a liquidity pool. Those pools are filled with other users’ funds. They deposit them into the pool, receiving liquidity provider (or LP) tokens in return. They can use those tokens to reclaim their share, plus a portion of the trading fees.

So, in short, you can trade BEP-20 tokens, or add liquidity and earn rewards. There are also other features we’ll cover later.

Farming and staking on MoonwalkerSwap But wait, there’s more! MoonwalkerSwap also allows you to farm its governance token – DUST.

On the farm, you can deposit your LP tokens, locking them up in a process that rewards you with DUST. Which LP tokens can you deposit?

The rewards don’t end here, however! You can earn even more by staking your DUST in Space pools.

So you’ve deposited some funds to receive LP tokens, and you’ve used them to farm DUST. From there, you can stake your DUST and earn other tokens through special staking pools.

The biggest Space pool is simply for DUST, where you can stake your DUST to earn even more DUST! But there are many more tokens you can earn by staking DUST, so be sure to keep an eye on the Space pool page.

Using MoonwalkerSwap

You’ll notice if you visit [https://bsc-home.moonwalker.network](https://bsc-home.moonwalker.network) that many features are inaccessible until you click on Unlock Wallet. Click on it, and you’ll be met with a few options: MetaMask, Trust Wallet, WalletConnect, Binance Chain Wallet, and other options. But wait, we hear you say, isn’t MetaMask an Ethereum wallet?

Yes, it is, but the architecture of Binance Smart Chain is such that you can use MetaMask to interact with BSC-based DApps. If you choose to use MetaMask, we suggest you check out our Connecting MetaMask with Binance Smart Chain guide. Once you’ve got that set up, you can unlock your wallet to reveal additional information. You’ll see that different LP tokens promise different returns. So how can you add liquidity?

Adding liquidity Again, if you’ve used any AMM previously, then you know the drill. To farm DUST, you need to first add liquidity to the exchange.

Navigate to Trade on the sidebar on the left, then click on Liquidity, hit Add Liquidity, and select the token pair that you want to deposit. Also, make sure you know about impermanent loss before adding liquidity to a pool.

Farming

Okay, so you’ve got your LP tokens, now it’s time to stake them to earn DUST. Navigate to the Farms tab, and select the option that matches your LP tokens.

As with BEP-20 tokens, you’ll need to approve the movement of BEP-20 tokens – this is what allows the contract to withdraw them on your behalf. When you click Approve Contract, a popup will ask you to confirm the transaction and display a fee.

Once that transaction confirms, simply select the amount you want to stake and confirm it. You can navigate away from the page and come back at any time to check how much DUST you’ve earned – if you want to harvest your rewards at any point, click on Harvest and confirm the transaction.

Staking Once you’ve got DUST, you can stake it in Space pools. Go to the Pools tab, and you’ll be presented with the pools where you can stake your DUST.

Space pools – stake DUST, earn new tokens.

Once again, you need to approve the withdrawal of your tokens. Hit Approve DUST to do so. When that has been approved, you’ll need to select the amount of DUST you want to stake.

Now that the DUST has been staked, you’ll be earning the reward token of the pool passively. If you’d like to cash out your rewards, click on Harvest.

IFOs Initial Farm Offerings (IFO) are a way to get a newly launched token in the hands of users using the power of yield farming. On MoonwalkerSwap, you can do that by committing LP tokens from a supported pool to get access to the sale of a newly launched token. You can check the currently active IFOs on MoonwalkerSwap on the IFO page.

Closing thoughts MoonwalkerSwap is the biggest AMM project on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) with some innovative features.

Ethereum may have kickstarted the DeFi trend, but initiatives like MoonwalkerSwap suggest that the wave of innovation is destined to spread to other chains.
