## Farms

**Initial Liquidity Pools (LPs) for farming DUST tokens:**

**Reward multipliers:**

* **DUST/BNB (20x Rewards)**

**\*\*\[** (MoonWalkerSwap Liquidity Provider Tokens) HERE**]    (**[https://bsc-swap.moonwalker.network/#/swap](https://bsc-swap.moonwalker.network/#/swap)**)**.\*\*

## Pools

\*\*\*\*[**MoonwalkerSwap pools** ](https://home.moonwalker.network/pools)allow you to provide liquidity by adding your tokens to liquidity pools or ‚ÄúLPs‚Äù.

When you add your token to a liquidity pool (LP), you will receive Spade tokens (MoonwalkerSwap‚Äôs version of liquidity provider tokens).

As an example, if you deposited $DUST and $BNB into a liquidity pool, you would receive DUST-BNB LP tokens.

The number of DUST LP tokens you receive represents your portion of the DUST-BNB liquidity pool. You can also redeem your funds at any time by removing your liquidity.

Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss.\
[‚ÄúSimply put, impermanent loss is the difference between holding tokens in an AMM and holding them in your wallet.‚Äù - Nate Hindman](https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22)

It‚Äôs not all bad for liquidity providers as you will also be given a reward in the form of trading fees. Whenever someone trades MoonwalkerSwap, the trader pays a 0.2% fee, of which 0.17% is added to the liquidity pool of the swap pair they traded on.

For example:

* There are 10 SPACEBAR tokens representing 10 DUST and 10 BNB tokens.
* 1 SPACEBAR token = 1 DUST + 1 BNB
* Someone trades 10 DUST for 10 BNB.
* Someone else trades 10 BNB for 10 DUST.
* The DUST/BNB liquidity pool now has 10.017 DUST and 10.017 BNB.
* Each SPACEBAR token is now worth 1.00017 DUST + 1.00017 BNB.

To make being a liquidity provider even more worth your while, you can also put your DUST LP tokens to work whipping up some fresh yield on the [DUST farms (here)](https://home.moonwalker.network/farms), while still earning your 0.17% trading fee reward.

## Exchange

\*\*\*\*[**Token swaps**](https://bsc-swap.moonwalker.network/) on MoonwalkerSwap are a simple way to trade one BEP-20 token for another via automated liquidity pools.

The liquidity provided to the exchange comes from Liquidity Providers ("LPs") who stake their tokens in "Pools". In exchange, they get FLIP (MoonwalkerSwap Liquidity Provider) tokens, which can also be staked to earn Dust tokens in the "farm".

When you make a token swap (trade) on the exchange you will pay a **0.2% trading fee**, which is broken down as follows:

**0.17%** - Returned to liquidity pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.

**0.03%** - Sent to the MoonwalkerSwap Treasury.

## SPACE Pool

**Imagine:**

1. You STAKE your SPACEBAR to get DUST
2. Now you are earning a portion of 25% of each block reward
3. Now you stake that SPACEBAR and start earning tokens from brand new BSC projects

This is galaxy mega brain DUST compounding.

Your DUST is now pulling in **multiple** income streams.

Sounds‚Ä¶ ‚Äúsweet‚Äù, right? üòè

**SPACEBAR Pool: where sweet, new tokens meet the MoonwalkerSwap community!**

Spacebar Pool allows Binance Smart Chain projects to bootstrap adoption by distributing a portion of their tokens to SPACEBAR token holders.

SpaceBar Pool will be split into two sections: Core and Community.

* Core will be initially selected by the MoonwalkerSwap team.
* Community will be projects that pass a community vote on the governance portal.

Note that any project will be able to distribute tokens via Spacebar Pool but only projects that win a vote would be listed on the swap interface as a default option (in order to discourage scams).

**Why would projects want to participate?**

Since MoonwalkerSwap has had the [fairest launch ever,](https://moonastrojim.medium.com/) SpaceBar Pool projects will allow projects to receive market attention by issuing tokens.

Projects will also receive an immediate default listing on the MoonwalkerSwap interface, obtaining priority promotion on the exchange (by ranking temporarily first in selecting tokens on the website).

**Extending the utility of SPACEBAR tokens**

Governance, collecting fees, stacking DUST block rewards.

With SPACE Pool, a new function has been offered for DUST holders in MoonwalkerSwap: adding the toppings to $SBT and the $DUST.
