## Auto DUST Space Pool

### Stake DUST, earn more DUST!

**Staking DUST**

* You need to harvest or compound (reinvest) your DUST by yourself. That means returning to the site, tapping buttons, and using a bit of BNB for transaction fees.
* Interest is displayed as APR, which doesn‚Äôt include compounding.
* Deposits [SpaceBar Token](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MjsHJz3bXkrpWm-4f79/space-pool-faq.md#whats-spacebar-token) to your wallet upon staking

**Auto DUST**

* Stake your DUST and forget about it! The DUST you stake in this Space Pool will be automatically compounded (reinvested) for you, minus a small fee.
* The ‚Äúautomatic‚Äù compounding function is triggered by other users who get a small bounty for triggering it.
* Interest is displayed as APY, which includes compounding.
* A small performance fee is subtracted from your earnings each time the pool is automatically compounded. See below.
* An unstaking fee applies when you unstake within 3 days of manually staking. See below.
* Does not deposit SpaceBar to your wallet upon staking

#### What are the fees for the Auto DUST Space Pool?

**Deposit fee**

* **None**

**Unstaking fee**

* **0.1%‚Ä®   if you unstake (withdraw) within 72 hours.**
* Only applies within 3 days of staking.
* After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
* The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more DUST in the pool.
* This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.

**Performance fee**

* **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
* For example, if the harvest was 1 DUST, then 0.02 DUST would be subtracted as the performance fee.

{% hint style="info" %}
The DUST collected via the unstaking fee and performance fee is **burned every week** as part of the regular DUST token burns.

This is a good thing for DUST holders because it reduces the overall amount of DUST tokens in existence, which helps reduce inflation.
{% endhint %}

#### What's the best way to use the Auto DUST in Space Pool?

Simple: stake your DUST, but only withdraw after 72 hours (if you need to). This way you only pay the performance fee, and not the unstaking fee.

## Space Pool FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Troubleshooting

#### **I can't find the Space Pool I was staking in!**

You should be able to find the Space Pool under the ‚ÄúFinished‚Äù tab on the Space Pools page.

By selecting ‚ÄúStaked Only‚Äù, it will make it easier to find your assets.

#### **Why can‚Äôt I unstake my tokens from a Space Pool?**

If you are unable to unstake from the Stake Dust, Earn DUST pools, please check to make sure that you haven‚Äôt sold the SpaceBar tokens in your wallet. This token acts as a \`proof of ownership\` over your DUST.

#### **Why did my earned tokens go to zero after staking/unstaking?**

Don‚Äôt worry! They‚Äôre in your wallet already.

Whenever you stake or unstake from a Space Pool or farms, your earned tokens get harvested and sent to your wallet at the same time.

### **General Questions**

#### How is APR for Space Pools calculated?

> Space Pool APR = Annualized rewards (USD) / User funds staked in Space Pool (USD) \* 100

As a basic example, let's take a 60-day pool with 300,000 USD worth of rewards, and 3,000,000 USD worth of DUST staked in it.

The APR fluctuates as more DUST is staked by users, and as the price of DUST, and the reward token, vary.

|                                                       | **Calculation**                  | Amount            |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Total rewards to distribute (USD value)               |                                  | 300,000 USD       |
| Distribution period                                   |                                  | 60 days           |
| Daily distribution                                    | 300,000 / 60 =                   | 5,000 USD daily   |
| **Annualised rewards (USD value)**                    | 5,000 \* 365 =                   | **1,825,000 USD** |
| **Value of DUST staked by users in pool (USD value)** |                                  | **3,000,000 USD** |
| **APR**                                               | (1,825,000 / 3,000,000) \* 100 = | **60.833% APR**   |

#### **What does the ‚ÄúEnd‚Äù number on my Space Pool refer to?**

This shows the amount of blocks left until the rewards for that pool stop being distributed. Once the pool has reached that block, you should unstake your tokens, because you won‚Äôt be receiving any rewards after that.

#### **Where do the rewards from Space Pools come from?**

There are three main types of Space Pools.

1. Stake DUST, earn DUST
2. Stake DUST, earn other tokens.&#x20;
3. Stake other tokens, earn DUST

The rewards for the "Stake DUST, earn DUST" Space Pools come from the [DUST emissions](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics). Each block, a number of DUST tokens are allocated as rewards for these pools.

The rewards for the "Stake DUST, earn other tokens" type are provided by the project teams who sponsor a Space Pool.

For the "Stake other tokens, earn DUST" type, the MoonwalkerSwap treasury buys back DUST from the market to distribute as rewards. These pools are funded by MoonwalkerSwap, not by the projects themselves.

#### What‚Äôs SpaceBar Token?

MoonwalkerSwap‚Äôs SpaceBar Token is deposited in your wallet when you interact with the ‚ÄúStake DUST, Earn DUST‚Äù Space Pool. It's not staked for

It‚Äôs basically an IOU that shows how much DUST you‚Äôve staked in the pool.

It‚Äôll be returned automatically when you unstake your DUST from that pool.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don‚Äôt sell your SpaceBar tokens! You need to return your SpaceBar to unstake your DUST from the DUST pool. The amount of SpaceBar you return must be the same as the amount of DUST you unstake.
{% endhint %}
