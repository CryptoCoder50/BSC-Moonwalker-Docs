## Farms and Space Pools

Farms incentivize users to provide liquidity for your trading pair by distributing DUST to your pair's LP Token holders.

Space Pools are a way of distributing your tokens to BSC users who stake DUST in the pool.

These two products go hand-in-hand on MoonwalkerSwap: when a project provides their tokens for a Space Pool, we'll also create a Farm. If you're looking to distribute tokens and incentivize liquidity, get in touch.

* Please don't email us to apply - we only respond to applications via the application form.
* Please don't chase us for a response on your application. We have a constant backlog of quality projects reaching out to us.

### How long will it take to get a response?

We aim to respond to applications within a week, but due to the large number of requests, we’re unable to respond to every single applicant. If you don’t hear back from us within two weeks of applying, try reaching out to moonwalkerjim on Discord, with **the name of your project, your token ticker, and the date you applied**.

### What are the qualifying criteria for Community VS Core?

Qualifying criteria for Community Farms and Core Farms/Pools are based on our internal review process. We don’t publish them externally. If you’re not eligible for a Core Farm, we may invite you to apply for a Community Farm instead.


## IFOs \(Token Sales\)

"IFO" \(Initial Farm Offering\) is a new model of token sale pioneered by MoonwalkerSwap. Here's how it works, in short:

* Users buy your token with DUST-BNB LP tokens
* After the sale, we distribute the BNB to you and burn the DUST.

## Listing on the Exchange <a id="exchange"></a>

### How can I list my token on the exchange?

Anybody can "list" any BEP-20 network token on MoonWalkerSwap. You don't need to contact us or ask permission. You just need to [add liquidity to a liquidity pool](../products/swap.mooonwalker.network/moonwalkerswap-pools.md) - that's it. Traders can then trade your token by entering your token's contract address.

### How can I add my token's logo/icon?

Please add your icon to Trust Wallet’s assets repo, which MoonwalkerSwap references: [https://github.com/trustwallet/assets](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets)

### Someone made a fake copy of my token! Can you block it?

Due to MoonwalkerSwap’s nature as an AMM-based DEX, we’re not able to prevent the trading of any BEP-20 token. We recommend ensuring that your token contract is clearly visible and verifiable on your site, and educating your users about how to safely trade your token.

### People get an error when trading my token. What can I do?

Check our [Troubleshooting page](../help/troubleshooting.md) for a list of common errors on the exchange, and how to solve them.

## Something else

You can shoot us an email at support@moonwalker.network if the above parts don't cover your questions.

Please don't try to contact us via this email for [customer support](customer-support.md), that's not what it's for and we won't respond: your best option for getting help with the product is via the [Discord or Reddit community](discord.md).
