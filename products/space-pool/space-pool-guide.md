# How to Stake in Space Pools

![](../../.gitbook/assets/docs-masthead-15-.png)

Staking in [Space Pools](https://docs.moonwalker.network/products/space-pool) lets you earn DUST or other tokens while you sleep!

It's simpler than farming with MoonwalkerSwap's Yield Farms, because unlike the Farms, you only need to stake **one token** to start earning: usually DUST.

## **Getting started with Space Pool staking**

1. Go to the Pools page [here](https://home.moonwalker.network/pools).

3. Click **Unlock Wallet**.

Other Space Pools let you stake your DUST to earn dozens of other cool tokens. Make sure you check them out.

5. Once you choose a pool, click the **Enable** button. Your wallet will ask you to confirm the action.

9. The Confirm button will change to **"**Confirming", then once the transaction is successful, you’ll see your staked amount change and the button will change again.

10. You should now be able to see details on your Space Pool. The other pools will show a **Collect** button to claim your staking rewards into your wallet.

### **Adding and removing DUST from a pool** 

You can easily add more DUST to a Space Pool, or move some DUST to a more profitable pool. Here’s how you can move your staked DUST.

1. Click the **-** to take some DUST out of a pool, or the **+** to add more to the pool.

2. A window will open. If you clicked the **+**, choose the amount you would like to add to the pool. If you clicked the **-**, choose the amount to take out of the pool.
