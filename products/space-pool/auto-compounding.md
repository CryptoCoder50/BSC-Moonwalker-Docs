# Auto DUST Syrup Pool

## Stake DUST, earn DUST!

![Auto DUST &amp; Manual DUST Pools](../../.gitbook/assets/auto-and-manual-pools.png)

**Staking DUST**

* You need to harvest or compound \(reinvest\) your DUST by yourself. That means returning to the site, tapping buttons, and using a bit of BNB for transaction fees.
* Interest is displayed as APR, which doesn’t include compounding.
* Deposits [SpaceBar Token](space-pool-faq.md#whats-spacebar-token) to your wallet upon staking

**Auto DUST**

* Stake your DUST and forget about it! The DUST you stake in this Space Pool will be automatically compounded \(reinvested\) for you, minus a small fee.
* The “automatic” compounding function is triggered by other users who get a small bounty for triggering it.
* Interest is displayed as APY, which includes compounding.
* A small performance fee is subtracted from your earnings each time the pool is automatically compounded. See below.
* An unstaking fee applies when you unstake within 3 days of manually staking. See below.
* Does not deposit SpaceBar to your wallet upon staking

### What are the fees for the Auto DUST Space Pool?

**Deposit fee**

* **None**

**Unstaking fee** 

* **0.1%    if you unstake \(withdraw\) within 72 hours.**
* Only applies within 3 days of staking.
* After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
* The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more DUST in the pool.
* This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.

**Performance fee**

* **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
* For example, if the harvest was 1 DUST, then 0.02 DUST would be subtracted as the performance fee.

{% hint style="info" %}
The DUST collected via the unstaking fee and performance fee is **burned every week** as part of the regular DUST token burns. 

This is a good thing for DUST holders because it reduces the overall amount of DUST tokens in existence, which helps reduce inflation.
{% endhint %}

### What's the best way to use the Auto DUST in Space Pool?

Simple: stake your DUST, but only withdraw after 72 hours \(if you need to\). This way you only pay the performance fee, and not the unstaking fee.
